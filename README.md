========

A Chip-8 interpreter I wrote in a weekend for fun.

You may view a video of it running here:

The code has three files:

* Main.java
The entry point. Creates a MainWindow instance, creates an emulator instance, then runs the emulator.

* MainWindow.java
The window displayed to the user showing the screen of the Chip-8.

* Emulator.java
The main code for interpreting the Chip-8 system.

It needs a lot of clean-up, which I'm going to do eventually.

Thanks for viewing!
